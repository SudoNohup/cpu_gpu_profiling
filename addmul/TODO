BUGS:


//performance BUGS for MKL dgemm routine...
//1. why A= 2A result is right here? double check compute_error routine...
2. find the 2012 Strassen GOTOBLAS paper... (In the flash disk??)
//3. finish A*(B+E) routine and compare the performance...


G = B + E;
A * G

unpack C?

corner case handling? <8, <4???

why 5th loop -> pack B
why 4th loop -> pack A


GFLOPS? average after the first run?



A*B (m*k   x   k*n  -> how to pack B for m*k case)?
unpack C?

multi-core?
